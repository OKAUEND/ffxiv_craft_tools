# Pages

This component doesn't handle the layout of the entire page, it gets the key data from the backend.
Keys obtained from the backend are mainly expansion pack keys, battle levels, and battle non-combat keys.
By collecting these key information for each expansion pack and lowering them down, the initial data acquisition amount is narrowed down.

**!!**Screen layout is done with the **Template** component
